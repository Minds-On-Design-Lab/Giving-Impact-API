# Giving Impact - Stripe Online Fundraising

Giving Impactâ„¢ is designed to build on Stripe to provide you with the tools to create powerful online fundraising solutions.

Our suite of tools includes a fantastic dashboard for managing your fundraising initiatives and an API that allows your web development partners to create rich landing pages more efficiently.

We've designed our API to lead to a **refreshingly simple and customizable** experience. If you are brand new to Giving Impact, we'd recommend giving our [general introduction docs](http://givingimpact.com/docs/introduction/getting-started) a read. For those ready to get to integrating, please, engage!
